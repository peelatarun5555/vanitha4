        How can I make this book even more unique for you?
          Every time I see you, my dirty thoughts go through me,
          making me wonder whether I'm making you more dirty these days. 
          I adore you to the moon and back, but even though I know you are not mine,
          <br>I can't help but feel jealous of you all the time. 🤞💖
        </p>

        <p>
        I have never felt more comfortable in someone's company in my life 🤞.
          I'm still not sure what drives me to throw away every aspect of my life 
          and give it everything to you. You certainly are a skilled thief when it comes to stealing.
          I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful one of them as you 😭
        </p>
        <p>
         want you, i want all of you. i want you when you're happy, 
          and when you're sad. i want to wake up next to you every morning
          and fall asleep with you every night. i want to stare at the stars with you
          and talk for hours about everything you've ever dreamed of doing. 
          i want to travel around the world with your hand in mine,
          and i want to experience everything this life has to offer with you.
         but most of all, i want you, and i want us.
          forever.

         Since we live far away, I'm not sure how I'll be once I part ways with you. Will the procedure be alright for me to go through?
          However, occasionally you will enter my head to divulge all of my ideas. 
          <br>
          <p>
            I know you would be never be mine but, you would always be my favourite incomplete wish. <br> 
        <p>
         I'm drawn to the thought of you while I write these lines. Your grin has the ability to brighten my entire universe,
          much like a beacon in the deepest night. It's time I admitted that I can no longer deny the nagging voices in my heart that you are mine.
         What if we combined our experiences into one that was a story of love, passion, 
          and undying devotion? I picture long Sunday mornings spent together, kisses that 
          are stolen, and a lifetime of experiences. Will you be writing this epic romance with someone else?
         eagerly for your reply.

         We were once strangers who never really cared about eachother's existence... 
          Little did I know that you'll be the most important person in my life...
          And now everyday before I fall asleep the only thing I want is your presence tomorrow a
          nd for the days to come and now I've realised I'm not ready to lose you 
          and honestly I'll never be ready for that day...

         I am not good at holding conversations . can i hold your hand  instead?
          <br>
        There’s a certain magic in the air when you’re near, a magnetic pull that draws
          me closer with each passing day. I find solace in the comfort of your presence,
          and the thought of you brings a smile to my face even on the gloomiest of days.🥺
